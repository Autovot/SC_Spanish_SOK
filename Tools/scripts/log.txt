From the snowy wastelands of microTech to the floating city of Orison, there is still much for you to learn and discover. If you ever need further assistance, you can seek the guidance of experienced players through the Guide system on Spectrum (on the Roberts Space Industries website), read the helpful posts in the online Knowledge Base, or ask for a helping hand in chat. Your journal is also a valuable resource, containing entries that summarize and elaborate on everything covered in the tutorial.\n\nBut once you venture beyond the major cities and space stations, take care. Outside of these protected armistice zones you will encounter many dangers in the search for profit. Wherever your next steps take you, safe flying!\n\nPRACTICE MAKES PERFECT\nIf you’re interested in practicing flying or experiencing combat without risking your ship, Star Citizen features an arcade mode called ‘Arena Commander’ as an option in the game’s main menu.\n\nMOBIGLAS\nYour mobiGlas personal computer features a variety of functions and apps essential to life in the ‘verse.  Below is a list of all the apps, listed in the order they appear, that are accessible via the icons at the bottom of your mobiGlas.\n\n_______________________________________\nMOBIGLASS APPS\n\nHome – Displays information about your personal status including your health and how many credits you have to your name.\n\nHealth - Up to date information about your current physical health and any injuries you may be experiencing.\n\nComms – Shows chat channels, friends, and pending invites to the party system. Create a party, invite other players, or send friend requests here. You can also activate or deactivate proximity-based voice chat from this app.\n\nContracts – View, accept, and manage contracts. The Contracts app is divided into the following tabs: General, Accepted, and History.\n• The Verified and Unverified toggle allows you to choose between displaying local contracts certified to meet UEE and local law requirements, and contracts sent from unknown sources that could potentially violate local laws.\n• Once you accept an offer, contracts are moved to the Accepted Tab, and once a contract ends, either through successful completion or by other means, a record of it is kept in the History Tab.\n\nMaps – Access Local Maps and the Star Map to set routes and place personal markers.  \n\nJournal – A record of useful information and documents, including tutorial information.\n\nAssests – Locate any assets you have stored across the 'verse. Selecting an asset will provide added details.\n\nRep – Track your reputation with individual organizations or contacts.\n\nWallet – Send aUEC to any player. Party members will be pinned to the top of the selection list.\n\nLanding – While landed at an appropriate location, select from services for your vehicle like repair, restock, and refuel.\n\nVehicles – Customized the loadout, including components or paints, for any vehicle you own that are stored at your current local location. Components you wish to use must be in your local inventory.\n\n\n\n

[ea_popup_body_ModeDisclaimer_Resource,P] => This game mode is a special limited test used to collect feedback on several new features being developed for the upcoming Engineering gameplay for Star Citizen's vehicles. It is not representative of the current Persistent Universe or intended final version of the game.\n \nFull details on the feature, everything included in this test and feedback focus can be found on the Spectrum link by clicking “Provide Feedback” below.\n \nNew Features:\n    - 3 Game Modes: Duel (A2 vs A2), Squadron Battle (A2 vs Gladius) and Free Flight.\n    - Fuses: Each player has fuses in their inventory. These can be used to fill empty slots in the relay or exchange broken fuses of the relays.\n    - Engineering Panel: This panel gives players an overview of the state of components and how they are connected. Here players will be warned about not sufficient power and if items are damaged and require repair. Additionally, players will see the states of the relays where warnings will be issued for missing or broken fuses.\n    - Damage done by attacking ships will now penetrate the hull and will damage ship items below. Players now can target the areas of ships where the ship components are placed.\n    - Power Management is partially present in this experimental mode where the focus is on simply turning items on and off to achieve power balance on the ship.\n    - Repair: Players have the Multitool with them to repair damaged ship items using the Salvage Repair mode. This mode will consume the RMC canister to bring back the health of your ship components.\n    - Additionally, we will use this mode as a test bed for some weapon balancing experiments. Details can be found in Spectrum.\n \nHow To Play:\n   - As part of the A2 crew you will spawn on-foot. To win, you must work together with your crew; filling the roles of Pilot, Gunners and Engineers.\n   - Access spare fuses in your inventory. Each player has a limited number of fuses, use them wisely.\n   - Use VOIP to communicate with your crew.\n \nFor this test we are interested in feedback on players’ survival times. How much longer does a fully crewed A2 survive against a fighter attack versus how long does it survive with no item maintenance. Additionally we would like to gather data on the lifetime of your ship components and the frequency of fuses breaking.\n \nAll vehicles featured in this test are non-customizable and purpose built for this test. Please give each a try and let us know what you think in the feedback threads.\n \nImportant Keybinds\nInventory: ~action(player_choice|pc_pit_inventory) \nPush to Talk (Team): ~action(player_input_optical_tracking|foip_pushtotalk)\nPush to Talk (Proximity): ~action(player_input_optical_tracking|foip_pushtotalk_proximity)

[p_protectandresupply_desc,P] => *FOR IMMEDIATE SYSTEM-WIDE RELEASE*\n\nAttention, XenoThreat forces started to ambush Naval convoy ships transporting vital supplies while en route to INS Jericho station in the Stanton System. The Navy has requested CDF forces to help recover these supplies from the wreckage and safely deliver them to Jericho station. All available CDF volunteers are encouraged to provide support.\n\nPlease note that the supplies are highly volatile if not handled correctly. Use caution while transporting these materials:\n* Zeta-Prolanide degrades over time until breaking down completely.\n* AcryliPlex Composite becomes explosively unstable if damaged.\n* Diluthermex releases a destructive energy pulse if exposed to quantum travel.\n\nWe were waiting for a delivery of Dynaflex to help arm the Javelin, however, that delivery was caught in the ambush. Find that Dynaflex to help us support you in this fight.\n\nAlso, XenoThreat hostiles might still be in the area so be careful. CDF volunteers with combat experience are also urged to contribute by securing these areas from lingering XenoThreat forces.\n\nSAIC Rowena Dulli from the Advocacy is the official attaché to the CDF and will be running the operation.

[p_showdown_PreXeno_desc,P] => Attention, Naval forces have regrouped for the final assault that XenoThreat have been planning. The Navy has officially requested any CDF volunteers to help provide combat support in this final push to secure our system. This will include volunteers outside of those who have participated in the Overdrive Initiative.\n\nSAIC Rowena Dulli from the Advocacy is the official attaché to the CDF and will be running the operation.\n\nIf successful, this will complete this Overdrive Initiative series and you will receive temporary access to the F7A Hornets or a free upgrade if you currently own an F7C.

[xenothreat_defend_HH_H_desc_001] => The Headhunters still haven’t learned their place in Pyro and are about to launch a full raid at ~mission(location|address). Unfortunately for them, you’re going to stop it. \n\nHead there ASAP, recruit allies if you need to, and prepare to neutralize their raiding party by any means necessary. That includes dealing with whatever reinforcements they decide to throw your way. \n\nYou have my full support.\n\nComm. Spec. Engler\n

[xenothreat_defend_HH_M_desc_001] => One of our scouts has been tracking increased Headhunter movement around ~mission(location|address) and we believe that they are prepping to launch a full attack there. \n\nWe have a small window of opportunity to neutralize their offensive, so we want you to get on site and prepare to mount a defense before the Headhunter forces arrive. \n\nWith the numbers they have in the area, there’s little chance they’ll be convinced to give up after a single attempt, so prep for reinforcements. \n\nComm. Spec. Engler\n

[xenothreat_defend_HH_VH_desc_001] => The amount of time the Headhunters waste taking us on, when they could be fighting Humanity’s real enemies is infuriating to say the least. And now, they’ve decided to launch a raid against ~mission(location|address). They can’t be allowed to succeed.\n\nGather any supplies and support you’ll need and head there before the attack starts. I’m guessing they won’t be prepared to be met with any formidable resistance, at least for the first wave of the assault. Any reinforcements they send will be better equipped, so be ready. \n\nHopefully once you put them down, they’ll finally learn their lesson. \n\nComm. Spec. Engler\n

[Tut03_Part03_Journal01_TraversingtheVerse_Content] => Congratulations!\n\nYou’ve completed the Star Citizen Tutorial and are ready to explore the universe! \n\nNow it’s up to you decide what your life in space will be like. The Contract Manager on your mobiGlas contains many different opportunities for you to pursue from simple delivery missions to dangerous criminal jobs. Work hard and you can build your reputation with different organizations to gain access to more rewarding contracts. Whether you choose to live a life of crime or hunt down bounties and enforce the law, it is up to you.\n\nHowever, if you’d rather forge your own path, feel free to use the StarMap in the mobiGlas and explore all the Stanton system has to offer. From the snowy wastelands of microTech to the floating city of Orison, there is still much for you to learn and discover. If you ever need further assistance, you can seek the guidance of experienced players through the Guide system on Spectrum (on the Roberts Space Industries website), read the helpful posts in the online Knowledge Base, or ask for a helping hand in chat. Your journal is also a valuable resource, containing entries that summarize and elaborate on everything covered in the tutorial.\n\nBut once you venture beyond the major cities and space stations, take care. Outside of these protected armistice zones you will encounter many dangers in the search for profit. Wherever your next steps take you, safe flying!\n\nPRACTICE MAKES PERFECT\nIf you’re interested in practicing flying or experiencing combat without risking your ship, Star Citizen features an arcade mode called ‘Arena Commander’ as an option in the game’s main menu.\n\nMOBIGLAS\nYour mobiGlas personal computer features a variety of functions and apps essential to life in the ‘verse.  Below is a list of all the apps, listed in the order they appear, that are accessible via the icons at the bottom of your mobiGlas.\n\n_______________________________________\nMOBIGLASS APPS\n\nHome – Displays information about your personal status including your health and how many credits you have to your name.\n\nCommlink – Shows chat channels, friends, and pending invites to the party system. Create a party, invite other players, or send friend requests here. You can also activate or deactivate proximity-based voice chat from this app.\n\nVehicle Loadout Manager – Customized the loadout, including components or paints, for any vehicle you own that are stored at your current local location. Components you wish to use must be in your local inventory.\n\nNikNax – Locate any assets you have stored across the 'verse. Selecting an asset will provide added details.\n\nSkyline – Access the StarMap set Quantum Travel routes by selecting a location and pressing the “Set As Destination” button. \n\nmo.Trader – Send aUEC to any player. Party members will be pinned to the top of the selection list.\n\nContracts Manager – View, accept, and manage contracts. The Contracts Manager is divided into the following tabs: General, Personal, Accepted, and History.\n• The General Tab displays local contracts certified to meet UEE and local law requirements. \n• The Personal Tab displays contracts sent specifically to your account, often from unknown sources that may violate local laws.\n• Once you accept an offer, contracts are moved to the Accepted Tab, and once a contract ends, either through successful completion or by other means, a record of it is kept in the History Tab.\n\nVehicle Maintenance Services – Repair, restock, and refuel your vehicles.\n\nJournal – A record of useful information and documents, including tutorial information.\n\nDelphi – Track your reputation with individual organizations or contacts.

All available CDF volunteers are encouraged to provide support.\n\nPlease note that the supplies are highly volatile if not handled correctly. Use caution while transporting these materials:\n* Zeta-Prolanide degrades over time until breaking down completely.\n* AcryliPlex Composite becomes explosively unstable if damaged.\n* Diluthermex releases a destructive energy pulse if exposed to quantum travel.\n\nAlso, XenoThreat hostiles might still be in the area so be careful. CDF volunteers with combat experience are also urged to contribute by securing these areas from lingering XenoThreat forces.\n\nSAIC Rowena Dulli from the Advocacy is the official attaché to the CDF and will be running the operation.

[Tut01_Journal02_TheBasics_Content] => [The universe of Star Citizen is a dynamic place, providing players with the ability to interact with much of the environment around them. The foundation of this ability is the game’s Interaction Mode. \n\nIf you are in range to interact with an object – like a door or item of food – a control hint will appear above it.  If you hold the interaction, a pop-up menu will open showing additional interaction options.\n\nWhen interacting with an interface, you can also scroll through the list of available options on the display. For example, you can scroll through the list of floor options while interacting with an elevator panel.\n\nFor all manners of interaction, you may prefer to use different keybinds. To view all the current keybinds or adjust them, use the Keybinding tab of the Options menu.]
[Tut02_Journal01_Trading_Content] => [The universe of Star Citizen has many unique pieces of equipment and clothing for you to use. These items may be looted from adversaries but can also be purchased from the numerous stores around the ‘verse. Specialized stores at major landing zones tend to have the necessary stock to cover your basic needs, whereas quieter areas might have unique variants or niche equipment.\n\nTo buy an item on display, approach it and an information box will appear displaying the brand logo, item name, and price, as well as control hints to BUY, TRY ON, or INSPECT the item. If you like what you see and have the necessary funds, selecting the BUY option will complete the purchase.\n\nYou can also use Interaction Mode to browse the shopping kiosks. While these kiosks are not as hands-on, it is easier to buy goods in volume through the kiosk interfaces. Kiosks also give you the option to choose where the items will be delivered – either to your local storage or directly to your personal inventory.\n\nTo sell items, first make sure that they are in your personal inventory, local storage, or are cargo on a vehicle stored at that location. Then you can interact with a shopping kiosk at a store and use the “SELL” tab. From there you will be given options to select which items you wish to sell. Not all stores will purchase all items.\n\nPERSONAL INVENTORY\nYour Personal Inventory is the storage on your character. You can use this screen to arrange and organize your items, transferring them between your Personal Inventory and Local Storage or equipping them to your character. Take note that certain items have requirements for when they can be equipped, such as armor needing to be placed on an undersuit. All inventories have a capacity bar near the top that indicates how much they can store. \n\nLOCAL STORAGE\nYour Local Storage is unique to the current zone you are in. For example, if you are on microTech you will no longer have access to your Area18 storage. While Local Storages are significantly larger than Personal Inventories, they still have their own maximum capacity.\n\nAs you accumulate a high number of items, you can use the tabs at the top of the Local Inventory window to filter through specific categories of items and equipment.\n\nVehicles also have their own storage capacity. This inventory is not shared with any other players aboard and remains accessible to you while onboard the vehicle or while that vehicle is parked at your current landing zone.\n\nLOSING ITEMS\nRemember, when you get into dangerous situations out in the ‘verse you risk losing your items! Things in your personal inventory at the time of your death will remain on your corpse and will need to be retrieved. The same is true when a vehicle is destroyed. There is a chance that other players will find and claim your lost items before you can.\n\nAnything in storage at a major city landing zone is safe regardless of what happens to you or your vehicles.]
