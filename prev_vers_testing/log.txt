[Hurston_RepUI_Description] => With a history stretching back over five hundred years, Hurston Dynamics is noteworthy for being not only one of the oldest continuously-operated family businesses in the Empire, but more recently for owning its own planet in the Stanton system. Over the course of fifteen generations of Hurstons, the company made its fortune selling a wide range of weapons to the military and civilians. In addition, Hurston Dynamics produces many of the refined materials and components that other weapon manufacturers rely on.

[Hurston_bounty_boss_dc_desc_001] => HURSTON DYNAMICS OUTSOURCING\nCONTRACT: Bounty Collection\nOUTSOURCE MANAGER: I. Takao\nRISK ASSESSMENT: High Risk Target (Armed Support)\n\nHurston Dynamics is seeking a contractor to complete a bounty for ~mission(TargetName). This bounty has proven extremely elusive so far, but intel reports have tracked the target and a cohort of their known associates to ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nHowever, there is a strong chance that ~mission(TargetName|Last) will not risk a confrontation unless absolutely forced to. It is our recommendation that you neutralize a significant portion of the criminal’s allies first in order to draw them out. The report indicates that a large party of these hostiles are currently near the ~mission(Location).\n\nPayment will be released only after the bounty has been deemed complete.\n\n\n\n\n** The information transmitted may contain confidential and/or privileged material.

This target and the large hostile force they are traveling with have just been reported raiding ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nHowever, if their MO holds true, ~mission(TargetName|Last) has typically remained hidden during attacks, preferring to direct their forces from afar.

[Journal_General_Hangar_Content] => With your recent acquisition of a Personal Hangar, we here at Landing Services wanted to take a moment to let you know of some of the benefits that come with being a hangar owner and what you can expect when traveling away from home.\n\n* Your Personal Hangar *\n\n- For your convenience, all hangars, Personal and Public, come equipped with a Fleet Manager terminal that can be used to exchange vehicles via the lift. Please be sure to stand clear while the platform is in motion.\n- When shopping at local stores or fulfilling local contracts, all acquired goods will be stored in the area’s warehouse. All hangars, Personal and Public, have a Freight Elevator which can be used to transfer items to and from the warehouse. Note that smaller items can be accessed via the Gear Storage System.\n- As this is a private space only accessible to you and your invited guests, you can feel safe in storing your personal belongings not only within the provided warehouse storage, but in the hangar itself.\n- Your Personal Hangar is capable of accommodating any of the vehicles that were part of your fleet at the time of it being assigned but be mindful that if you acquire larger vehicles in the future, you may need to use a Public Hangar to access them.\n\n* Public Hangars *\n\n- When visiting a location away from home, or accessing vehicles that your Personal Hangar can’t accommodate, a Public Hangar will temporarily be assigned to you.\n- Be mindful upon departure, that items left inside a Public Hangar or its local warehouse will be considered abandoned and will become the property of the local landing services. \n\nCongratulations again, and we hope that you enjoy your Personal Hangar for years to come.\n

[ea_popup_body_ModeDisclaimer_Resource,P] => This game mode is a special limited test used to collect feedback on several new features being developed for the upcoming Engineering gameplay for Star Citizen's vehicles. It is not representative of the current Persistent Universe or intended final version of the game.\n \nFull details on the feature, everything included in this test and feedback focus can be found on the Spectrum link by clicking “Provide Feedback” below.\n \nNew Features:\n    - 3 Game Modes: Duel (A2 vs A2), Squadron Battle (A2 vs Gladius) and Free Flight.\n    - Fuses: Each player has fuses in their inventory. These can be used to fill empty slots in the relay or exchange broken fuses of the relays.\n    - Engineering Panel: This panel gives players an overview of the state of components and how they are connected. Here players will be warned about not sufficient power and if items are damaged and require repair. Additionally, players will see the states of the relays where warnings will be issued for missing or broken fuses.\n    - Damage done by attacking ships will now penetrate the hull and will damage ship items below. Players now can target the areas of ships where the ship components are placed.\n    - Power Management is partially present in this experimental mode where the focus is on simply turning items on and off to achieve power balance on the ship.\n    - Repair: Players have the Multitool with them to repair damaged ship items using the Salvage Repair mode. This mode will consume the RMC canister to bring back the health of your ship components.\n    - Additionally, we will use this mode as a test bed for some weapon balancing experiments. Details can be found in Spectrum.\n \nHow To Play:\n   - As part of the A2 crew you will spawn on-foot. To win, you must work together with your crew; filling the roles of Pilot, Gunners and Engineers.\n   - Access spare fuses in your inventory. Each player has a limited number of fuses, use them wisely.\n   - Use VOIP to communicate with your crew.\n \nFor this test we are interested in feedback on players’ survival times. How much longer does a fully crewed A2 survive against a fighter attack versus how long does it survive with no item maintenance. Additionally we would like to gather data on the lifetime of your ship components and the frequency of fuses breaking.\n \nAll vehicles featured in this test are non-customizable and purpose built for this test. Please give each a try and let us know what you think in the feedback threads.\n \nImportant Keybinds\nInventory: ~action(player_choice|pc_pit_inventory) \nPush to Talk (Team): ~action(player_input_optical_tracking|foip_pushtotalk)\nPush to Talk (Proximity): ~action(player_input_optical_tracking|foip_pushtotalk_proximity)

This will be distributed among all CDF volunteers at assigned intervals. An indicator will appear on your HUD to measure these payouts.\n\nPlease note that the supplies are highly volatile if not handled correctly. Use caution while transporting these materials:\n* Zeta-Prolanide degrades over time until breaking down completely.\n* AcryliPlex Composite becomes explosively unstable if damaged.\n* Diluthermex releases a destructive energy pulse if exposed to quantum travel.\n\nSAIC Rowena Dulli from the Advocacy is the official attaché to the CDF and will be running the operation.

All inventories have a capacity bar near the top that indicates how much they can store. \n\nLOCAL STORAGE\nYour Local Storage is unique to the current zone you are in. For example, if you are on microTech you will no longer have access to your Area18 storage. While Local Storages are significantly larger than Personal Inventories, they still have their own maximum capacity.\n\nAs you accumulate a high number of items, you can use the tabs at the top of the Local Inventory window to filter through specific categories of items and equipment.\n\nVehicles also have their own storage capacity. This inventory is not shared with any other players aboard and remains accessible to you while onboard the vehicle or while that vehicle is parked at your current landing zone.\n\nLOSING ITEMS\nRemember, when you get into dangerous situations out in the ‘verse you risk losing your items! Things in your personal inventory at the time of your death will remain on your corpse and will need to be retrieved. The same is true when a vehicle is destroyed. There is a chance that other players will find and claim your lost items before you can.\n\nAnything in storage at a major city landing zone is safe regardless of what happens to you or your vehicles.
